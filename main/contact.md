title: Contact
---

I am generally best contacted by email. Other ways to keep in touch:

* You should follow me via Mastodon: [danso@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@danso).
* I host my projects on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/danso) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ninedotnine).
* I like to call my friends using [Tox](https://tox.chat). If we're not already contacts, you will need to ask me for my Tox ID.
* I regularly read [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/) and can be [contacted there](https://lobste.rs/u/danso).
* IRC users will often find me idling on Freenode as danso.

Historical:

* I previously used [diaspora](https://socializer.cc/people/6fd9f095caa16e45), but my account there is no longer active.
* I don't know what happened to [mastodon.network](https://mastodon.network/@danso). The website has been down for months; I've moved to [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@danso).
* I had high hopes for [Friendica](https://libranet.de/profile/danso), but it has few users.
* I still have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ninedotnine) account, but Mastodon is just better.
* You can recommend me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-soucy-25b454101/), or whatever people use LinkedIn for.
