This is where my music lives.

I've been playing many styles of piano for some 20 years now, and it's recently culminated in a Master of Music degree from the University of Ottawa. I've since moved to Montreal to pursue further graduate studies.

I often perform recitals, fundraisers, and private events. [Contact me](/contact) if you are interested.

I also accompany voice and instrumentalists for auditions, performances, and the like.
